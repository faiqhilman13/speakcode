## 14:30 - CyberTrailer font sizes and space utilization
Increased font sizes and filled unused whitespace across all 8 cyberpunk trailer scenes. Main titles now 62-130px (from 46-64px), secondary text 28-42px (from 18-30px), icons enlarged to 28-44px. Expanded mockup images, icon containers, corner brackets, and spacing throughout.

## 16:00 - Created AgenticCodingTrailer with unified design system
Built 30-second editorial brutalism trailer using all three skills coherently. Generated 6 cohesive vector illustrations with warm cream backgrounds (#FDF6E3), geometric accents, and consistent flat vector style. Implemented unified color system (cream, black, coral, teal, yellow, gray), advanced patterns (spring animations, particle effects, pulsing glows, grid overlays, Ken Burns effect), and text backdrops for readability. All 6 scenes with warm/cool/dramatic variants for visual interest.

Output: out/agentic-coding-trailer.mp4 (10.1 MB)

## 16:30 - Fixed text readability with backdrop overlays
Added semi-transparent cream backdrop behind text for readability against vector illustrations. Adjusted text positioning (8% margins instead of 10%, 40% width instead of 45%). Reduced font sizes slightly for better balance. Added subtle shadows to text backdrops (more dramatic for "dramatic" variant scenes). Proper z-index layering so text sits above background elements.

## 17:00 - Attempted 1-minute script-based video (later deleted)
Created AgenticAcademyTrailer based on provided script with voiceover text support. Used nano-banana-builder for assets, remotion-video patterns, and frontend-design for unified aesthetic with cyan (#00BFFF) accents. Generated 6 scene assets but quality was inconsistent with poor animations. User rejected and requested deletion.

## 17:30 - Cleanup - Deleted unwanted videos and assets
Deleted AgenticAcademyTrailer, AgenticAcademyPro components, all 18 related scene assets, and asset generation scripts per user request. Only AgenticCodingTrailer remains as the good version. Updated Root.tsx and package.json to remove unwanted compositions and render commands.

Deleted:

## 18:00 - Extended AgenticCodingTrailer to 90 seconds with dynamic animations
Created AgenticCodingTrailerExtended with full 90-second trailer (2700 frames). Generated 8 new assets using nano-banana-builder (gemini-2.5-flash-image). Implemented rich dynamic animations using remotion-video patterns (enhanced particle system with 60-80 particles, floating geometric shapes, continuous motion). Added new components: AnimatedTimeline, BeforeAfterSplit, CurriculumCard. Applied frontend-design skill with warm editorial brutalism aesthetic maintained. Enhanced all scenes with increased particle counts, shape rotation, pulsing effects, and spring physics for responsive feel.

3. Before/After Split (0:36-0:54): Traditional vs Agentic coding comparison
4. Curriculum Overview (0:54-1:12): 4 floating cards showing topics
5. CTA (1:12-1:30): "Unlock Your Agency - Sign Up For Class"

Dynamic Enhancements:
- Particle count increased to 60-80 per scene
- Floating shapes with continuous rotation and pulsing
- Spring-based animations on all reveals
- Ken Burns zoom effect on images (1.05-1.15x)

## 18:30 - Restructured to 9 scenes (10s each) with new content and bug fixes
User feedback: Scenes too long (18s), need more content, curriculum cards not appearing. Generated 5 new assets using nano-banana-builder. Restructured to 9 scenes at 10s each (300 frames) for tighter pacing and more content coverage. Fixed CurriculumCard component positioning bug - removed transform translate(-50%, -50%) without proper parent, added explicit left/top positioning and width calculations. Added new scenes: Problem/Struggle, Solution/Agentic, Credentials/Authority, split curriculum into two scenes.

New Assets (5 files):

6. Credentials (0:50-1:00): "I Built This" - EY authority
7. Curriculum 1 (1:00-1:10): Multi-Agent Orchestration (single centered card)
8. Curriculum 2 (1:10-1:20): RAG & MCP Integration (single centered card)
9. CTA (1:20-1:30): "Unlock Your Agency - Sign Up For Class"

Bug Fixes:
- CurriculumCard: Fixed positioning with explicit left: "50%" top: "50%" transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
- Removed `position` prop that caused layout issues
- Added proper width: clamp(360px, 32vw, 480px) for card visibility
- Increased card padding to 48px for better spacing

Dynamic Enhancements:

## 19:00 - Merged curriculum into 1 scene with 5 module cards, replaced opaque backdrops with blur
User feedback: Curriculum should be 1 scene with cards for all modules, not 2 scenes. Prefers blurred background images instead of opaque backdrops for text clarity. Generated 5 new curriculum module assets using nano-banana-builder. Restructured to 8 scenes total (merged curriculum scenes 7 & 8 into single 20s scene). Removed all opaque backdrops from TextSlide and other text components, replaced with blur effect on background images and drop-shadow filters on text for readability.

New Curriculum Assets (5 files):
- curriculum-mental-model.png - Brain with AI agent nodes orbiting
- curriculum-fundamentals.png - Model, context, prompt icons
- curriculum-agent-harnesses.png - IDE vs TUI split composition
- curriculum-skills-mcp.png - Modular plugins with AGENTS.md
- curriculum-build-projects.png - Product interface with rocket ship

Curriculum Modules (5 cards in 1 scene):
1. New Mental Model - How to work with agents
2. Fundamentals - Models, context, prompt
3. Agent Harnesses - IDE vs TUI, different LLM models
4. Skills & MCPs - Plugins, MCPs, AGENTS.md
5. Build Real Projects - Ship production-ready apps

Scene Breakdown (8 scenes = 90s total):
1. Hook (0:00-0:10): Emotional question
2. Career Journey (0:10-0:20): Animated timeline
3. Problem (0:20-0:30): "The Old Way"

2. Dashboard: Vertical - wide image banner at TOP, content stacked below
3. Video: REVERSED - Image on LEFT, content on RIGHT
4. Pitch Deck: Diagonal split with angled clip-path and accent line
5. Research: Centered floating card over blurred background

**CyberShowcaseScene** - Full-screen cascading gallery:
