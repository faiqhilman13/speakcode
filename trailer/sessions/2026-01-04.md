## 13:50 - Updated ElevenLabs API key and regenerated voiceover

Updated ElevenLabs API key and voiceover script for the BuildAnythingTrailer. New script focuses on "build anything" messaging with philosophical insight.

**New Script:**
```
What if you could build anything?

Apps. Dashboards. AI agents. Research systems. Mobile apps.
Whatever your project needs.

The only question: can AI access it?
If yes — you can build it.

I used this approach to become App Lead on a 100,000-line enterprise platform.
Serving 30,000 users. No CS degree. No engineering background.

Here's the truth:
AI won't replace you.
But someone who knows how to work with AI will.
That person could be you.

In this course, you'll learn the mental model.
How to think about what's possible.
How to break problems down so AI can execute your vision.

Master agentic coding.
The skill of the decade.
Build whatever you want.
```

## 14:10 - Changed voice and sped up hook scene

1. Changed ElevenLabs voice ID to `alFofuDn3cOwyoz1i44T`
2. Compressed BuildAnythingHookScene from 7s to 2s (210 frames → 60 frames)
   - Word reveals now at frames 2, 5, 8, 11 (from 8, 14, 20, 26)
   - "build" at frame 18, "anything" at 28, final "Anything." at 40
   - Faster spring animations (damping: 18, stiffness: 350)
3. Updated trailer scene timings to account for shorter hook
4. Reduced total duration from 1500 to 1380 frames

**MentalModelScene:**
- Repositioned cards to center better (inverted V pattern)
- Increased card width (320 → 420 pixels)
- Larger icons (36 → 48px), titles (28 → 36px), badges (40 → 50px)
- Updated SVG connection line paths to match new positions
- Better vertical centering to fill unused space
