## 13:50 - Updated ElevenLabs API key and regenerated voiceover

Updated ElevenLabs API key and voiceover script for the BuildAnythingTrailer. New script focuses on "build anything" messaging with philosophical insight.

**New Script:**
```
What if you could build anything?

Apps. Dashboards. AI agents. Research systems. Mobile apps.
Whatever your project needs.

The only question: can AI access it?
If yes — you can build it.

I used this approach to become App Lead on a 100,000-line enterprise platform.
Serving 30,000 users. No CS degree. No engineering background.

Here's the truth:
AI won't replace you.
But someone who knows how to work with AI will.
That person could be you.

In this course, you'll learn the mental model.
How to think about what's possible.
How to break problems down so AI can execute your vision.

Master agentic coding.
The skill of the decade.
Build whatever you want.
```

## 14:10 - Changed voice and sped up hook scene

1. Changed ElevenLabs voice ID to `alFofuDn3cOwyoz1i44T`
2. Compressed BuildAnythingHookScene from 7s to 2s (210 frames → 60 frames)
   - Word reveals now at frames 2, 5, 8, 11 (from 8, 14, 20, 26)
   - "build" at frame 18, "anything" at 28, final "Anything." at 40
   - Faster spring animations (damping: 18, stiffness: 350)
3. Updated trailer scene timings to account for shorter hook
4. Reduced total duration from 1500 to 1380 frames

## 15:30 - Updated voiceover script with hackathon achievement

Added hackathon achievement to voiceover script (NDA-compliant, no company name).

**Updated Script:**
```
What if you could build anything?

Apps. Dashboards. AI agents. Research systems. Mobile apps.
Whatever your project needs.

The only question: can AI access it?
If yes — you can build it.

I used this approach to become a top 3 contributor on a 100,000-line enterprise AI platform.
Serving 30,000 users. Leading a 40-person engineering team.

Then I placed Top 5 in a national AI hackathon.
Against 150 participants. As a solo developer.

Here's the truth:
AI won't replace you.
But someone who knows how to work with AI will.
That person could be you.

In this course, you'll learn the mental model.
How to think about what's possible.
How to break problems down so AI can execute your vision.

Master agentic coding.
The skill of the decade.
Build whatever you want.

*Work in progress - voiceover script and scene animations still being refined*

## 16:00 - Updated voiceover script and scene timings

Revised voiceover script to match the WhatYouLearnScene content with 3 modules:

- "Then master the 5-step framework to orchestrate agents effectively."
- "And watch me build a real project from scratch."
- Added course benefits: "100 minutes of HD video. Real-world projects. Framework templates."

Adjusted scene timings:
- Scene 3 (Limit): 8-13s → 8-12s (-1s)
- Scene 4 (Founder Story): 13-37s → 12-37s, then reduced Phase 2 by 4s (9s→5s)

- Abstract agent icons (circular with inner symbol, no real logos) appearing with energy
- Punch line: "They don't ~~suggest~~. They **execute.**" + "You describe. They build."
- Dark background with radial red gradient, grid pattern, and floating energy particles
- Agent icons pulse with glow rings

### Scene 6: PeakScene (The Proof) - Multiple iterations
**Final layout uses `justify-content: space-between` to fill viewport:**

**TOP:** Header with "THE_OUTPUT: VERIFIED_RESULTS" + "Proof of the Agentic Path."

**MIDDLE:**
- Hero stat (dark card): Giant "TOP 5" (200px font) + "ASEAN AI HACKATHON" + description
- Secondary stats row (3 columns):
  - 100K+ Lines of Code (Enterprise platform)
  - 30K+ Users Served (Production system)
  - 40 Team Members (Led as App Lead)

**BOTTOM:** Transformation bar
- "6 MONTHS AGO: Stuck on features" → "TODAY: Shipping systems"
- "BUILT WITH AGENTIC CODING" stamp (rotated)

**Fixed AnimatedCounter** to show exact target values (was showing N-1 due to spring not reaching 1.0):
```tsx
const value = progress >= 0.99 ? target : Math.floor(target * progress);
```

### Scene 7: EmpowermentScene (Your Turn)
**Before:** Just "IT'S YOUR TURN" text on dark background
**After:**
- Torii gate silhouette callback (visual reference to Scene 3)
- Mirror viewer's state: "You have the **vision.** The idea. The drive."
- Hook: "The only thing missing? **THE METHOD.**"
- Bridge to curriculum: 3 phase badges (01 Mind → 02 Blade → 03 Strike)
- "3 PHASES TO MASTERY" subtext
- Rising particles animation + dual scanlines + corner accents
- Radial gradient background with dot grid
